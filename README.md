# Schmasteroids
## An Asteroids clone with vector display-esque graphics

Schmasteroids is a learning project to develop a simple game from scratch in C++.
It is currently for Windows only and can be downloaded from [www.nicklowerytheprogrammer.com/schmasteroids](www.nicklowerytheprogrammer.com/schmasteroids).

### Current Features
-Optimized software-rendered vector display-esque graphics
-Sound system that allows synchronization of graphical elements with musical beat
-Very dangerous aliens
-Written from scratch in C++, currently depends only on C stdlib and Windows system calls

### Features I Hope To Add Eventually
-Port for Linux and Mac
-Controller support
-Further optimization
-Further graphical flourishes
-Better collision detection
-Etc.
