# Schmasteroids
## An Asteroids clone with vector display-esque graphics

Schmasteroids is a learning project to develop a simple game from scratch in C++.

The website for the game is at [www.nicklowerytheprogrammer.com/schmasteroids](www.nicklowerytheprogrammer.com/schmasteroids).

### Current Features
- Optimized software-rendered vector display-esque graphics
- Sound system that allows synchronization of graphical elements with musical beat
- Very dangerous aliens
- Written from scratch in C++, Windows version depends only on C stdlib and Windows system calls

### Features I Hope To Add
- Mac and Linux versions (SDL platform layer is working, I need to figure out how to do binary distribution)
- Controller support
- Further optimization so the game can run at a higher framerate
- Further graphical flourishes
- Better collision detection

- Etc.
